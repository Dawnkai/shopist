# shopist
Simple shopping list for managing the items you bought.
Built for myself as a learning project (react, flask, data warehouses, generating excel documents) and as entry in job resume.
Project still in progress.

### TODO:
* Generating template documents from data
* Testing
* Statistics and plots

Other, non-essential bugs and enchancements are listed in the issues, [here](https://github.com/Dawnkai/shopist/issues).
