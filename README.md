# shopist
Simple shopping list for managing the items you bought.
Built for myself as a learning project (electron, data warehouses, typescript, generating excel documents) and as entry in job resume.
Project still in progress.

## How to start

1. Install required packages using `npm`:
```bash
$ npm install
```
2. Run the app in development mode using:
```bash
$ npm start
```

### Generating mock data
The [mock data folder](https://github.com/Dawnkai/shopist/tree/main/mock_data) contains .csv files that can be used to add pre-made data into the database using a file called `script.py` in aforementioned folder. Just run it in that folder like this:
```bash
$ python script.py
```

### Future improvements:
* Testing
* Statistics and plots

Bugs and enchancements are listed in the issues, [here](https://github.com/Dawnkai/shopist/issues). The ones marked with `important` label are prioritized over others.
